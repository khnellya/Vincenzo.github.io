After collecting all the necessary information, the next phase involves enhancing the data and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for deeper analysis. 
To carry out this comparison, I plan to use two models: ChatGPT and Gemini. 
<p>
We used: 
-Zero-shot prompting: Involves asking the model to generate responses or solve tasks without any prior examples or context. It tests the model's ability to handle new or unfamiliar queries based solely on its training. 
-Few-shot prompting: Provides the model with a few example inputs and outputs to illustrate the desired response style or format. This technique helps the model understand the task better and generate more relevant and accurate responses. 
-Chain-of-thought prompting: Encourages the model to articulate its reasoning process in a step-by-step manner. This method helps the model break down complex problems, making its thinking process more transparent and ensuring thorough, well-reasoned answers.
