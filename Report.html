 Challenges and Solutions     
      <p>
Crafting Accurate SPARQL Queries: Developing precise queries to retrieve relevant data from the ArCo knowledge graph and avoiding irrelevant results.

Enhancing the ArCo Ontology: Adding new data connections to accurately represent De Stefani Vincenzo’s influence and filling gaps in the existing ontology.

Using Large Language Models (LLMs): Managing inconsistent output and ensuring LLMs provide accurate and relevant insights about Vincenzo’s artworks.

Building a User-Friendly Website: Designing and developing a visually appealing website that effectively showcases your research findings.

Maintaining Data Accuracy: Ensuring that newly added data is accurate and consistent within the ArCo knowledge graph.
        <p>
In this project, we have undertaken a comprehensive exploration of De Stefani Vincenzo’s contributions to Italian art. By developing precise SPARQL queries, comparing the effectiveness of different Large Language Models (Lms), and enriching the ArCo knowledge graph, we aim to enhance the understanding of Vincenzo's artistic impact. Through these initiatives, we seek to offer deeper insights into Vincenzo's legacy and contribute to the broader appreciation of Italian art heritage.
